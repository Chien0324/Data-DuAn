WEAN started his professional musical journey in 2018 with “She Said” and “RETROGRADE”, both written and performed by WEAN in collaboration with Naomi. WEAN released his first solo single "AI BIET” in 2019, which became a major success and got massive positive response from both critics and general audiences. AI BIET ranked 41st on YouTube TOP TRENDING in Vietnam right after its release. AI BIET has reached more than 9 million streams including 7.5 million views on Youtube alone and the numbers are still climbing. In early 2020, WEAN teamed up with Aki from Vietnam’s trendsetting Punk Rock band 7UPPERCUTS in "Alone", a blissful hip-hop track about the melancholy of unrequited love that is still being played all over Vietnam.

Apart from music, WEAN has a burning passion for fashion and his clothing brand, Lazythink is a big hit. He was featured on local and regional fashion magazines including ELLE China. As a multi-talented artist, WEAN starred in the highschool action comedy feature film “Ba Vuong Hoc Duong” in 2018, without prior acting experience. In July 2020, WEAN starred in “The Unseen River” by director Pham Ngoc Lan, which was screened at the Lorcano Film Festival in Switzerland.
