Born in 2000 in Hanoi, Trần My Anh was nurtured by a family of musical influences who greatly inspired her to develop her own sense of music. Started from uploading covers of her favorite songs on Youtube at the age of 9 to writing her own songs at around 12 in her tiny bedroom with just a guitar, she only ever dreamed of becoming a known singer-songwriter under the name of marzuz. She believes music is her only means of communication, as an introverted kid who could never confide in anyone. 
 In 2016, marzuz uploaded her first original song “Mai,” - a soft acoustic song where she portrayed love and vulnerability - on Soundcloud, without expecting the song would be able to travel so far along the country. People started recognizing her as marzuz and was waiting for more of her music. During the course of 2016 to 2020, she started working with producers such as Onionn., Kewtiie,… and put out a few more songs that moved the audience such as “Fortune” - a sensual future-bass track, “Nếu” - an emotional flow diving into her deep view of the world and the reality of mental illness, “3 PHÚT” - a hip-hop RnB track where she spilled honest truth about her being a 17-year-old wanting to be apart of the harsh music and entertainment industry, “Và Thế Giới Đã Mất Đi Một Người Cô Đơn”… 
 marzuz believes in the freedom of music as in wanting to experiment with many different genres of music, but never losing the very core of her art - it being true to her feelings and experiences.
